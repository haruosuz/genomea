Dear Sir or Madam:

  We would like to submit the manuscript entitled 'Draft genome sequence of *Legionella pneumophila* isolated from deserts in Egypt.' by ***FIRST_AUTHOR*** et al. for publication in *Genome announcements*.  

  We determined the draft genome sequence of *Legionella pneumophila*. Estimated genome size and G+C content of the strain were close to those of a reference strain. The genome sequence data in this study will provide useful information for understanding the evolution of the *Legionella pneumophila*.  

  The manuscript has been seen and approved by all authors. We would be very grateful if you could consider this paper for publication in *Genome announcements*.

Yours sincerely,
